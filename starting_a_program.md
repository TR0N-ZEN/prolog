To start prolog program one way is to call the program *SWI-Prolog* from the gui or it's alias *swipl* from your command line interface like so:
```CMD
swipl
```
To load a .pl file simultaniously to starting *swipl* lets say you want to load *file_1.pl* you enter:
```CMD
swipl file_1.pl
```
or if you have already startet *swipl*
```CMD
[file_1]
```
